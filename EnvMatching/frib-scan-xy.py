All code inputs are mks with the exception of particle kinetic energy (eV).   

To run this Warp script:
  Interactive (return to interpreter after executing):

    % python -i frib-scan-xy.py 

  Non-interactive (exit interpreter after executing):

    % python frib-scan-xy.py

This setup scripts for these simulations are large and have been broken 
apart into functional sections to aid maintainability.

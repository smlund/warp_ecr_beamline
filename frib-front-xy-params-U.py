# --- Species initial thermal phase-space area measures

#          temp_z = longitudinal temperature [eV]  (after extractor accel value)
#          emitnx = normalized x-plane thermal rms emittance ** NOT edge measure **
#          emitny = normalized y-plane thermal rns emittance ** NOT edge measure **
#      * Can set individual dictionary values as in ibeam to tune as necessary.   
# 
#  Approach: Allow setting of transverse thermal phase-space area by either a 
#            temperature specification 
#            OR a normalized rms emittance measure. Convert input values to a normalized rms 
#            edge emittance to work with the Warp loader.

#  Notes:
#  * Guilliaume:  Ions likely 2-3 eV and electrons few to 100s of keV.  
#                 Ions not equilibrated with electrons.
#  * Previous simulations used 0.4*mm*mr thermal phase-space area 
#    launched outside of magnetic field.      
#  * We set only the *thermal* component of the emittance and the distribution without 
#    correlation terms. Later, correlation terms are set to produce the value of canonical angular 
#    momentum desired based on axial magnetic field values at launch or birth. 
#  * Syntax is used to allow different phase space area measures for each species. Initial runs 
#    may employ a common value for all species.

# --- Species initial canonical angular momentum.
# 
#     Note: <P_theta>/(m*c) for each species behaves like a normalized emittance contributing to beam 
#     phase-space area. 
#
# Each ion species is assumed to be born from neutral to its full charge state instantly at birth. 
# birth_mode specifications below allow effective tuning of <P_theta> to cover a range of possibilities.     
#
# birth_mode = 0: Ions born at launch point B of applied field.
#                   * Option does nothing to adjust load to reflect initial distribution correlations 
#                     from being born at different magnetic field values within the ECR ion source.  
#              1: Ions born with statistical canonical angular momentum specified by species 
#                 with values set by a species dictionary: 
#                        pthetabeam = {key: value} value = <P_theta>/(m*c) [m-rad] 
#                   * Allows detailed tuning of distribution.
#              2: Ions born consistent with a specified field value and rms beam size.  
#                   * Allows adjusting <P_theta> consistent with beam being born a specified size 
#                     in a specified magnetic field.  
#                        rms_birth = sqrt(<r^2>) at birth [m]
#                        bz0_birth = B_z(r=0) at birth [Tesla]                       
#              3: Ions are born randomly between two peaks in the ECR ion source B-field. 
#                   * Each ion is born at a different B-field using a uniform spatial
#                     distribution between peaks of ECR field. 
#
#  * Angular velocities are added to the ions to conserve the linear approx 
#    statistical canonical angular momentum in birth_mode = 1,2 and 3  
#  * birth_mode = 2,3 only take into account the linear approx solenoidal (B_z) field component of 
#    source field. 
#  * birth_mode = 2 can be set with the average field value between the two peak values of the ECR 
#    ion source field and the likely size of the beam in the ECR to give an approx guess 
#    consistent with a particular ECR. 
#  * For birth_mode = 2, rms_launch = 2.8 mm, bz0_launch = 2.15 T
#    gives <P_theta>/(m*c) = 0.384 mm-mrad for U33 with the present setup.

#  Comment: 
#   * See stptcl routine for how loading works. 
#   * Neutralization is NOT taken into account in the loading.    
#   * At present, all species are loaded with the same value of distrbtn.  
#   * rms equivalent beam loaded with the specified distribution from:  
#     KV => KV Distribution 
#
#     SG => semi-Gaussian distribution 
#             (KV density and local Gaussian angle spread about KV flutter) 
#
#     TE => Pseudoequilibrium with Thermal  Equilibrium form 
#     WB => Pseudoequilibrium with Waterbag Equilibrium form
#             The Pseudoequilibrium distributions use continuous focused
